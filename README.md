_QMediathekView_ is an alternative Qt-based front-end for the database maintained by the [MediathekView](http://zdfmediathk.sourceforge.net/) project. This program has fewer features than the Java-based original, but should consume less resources.

The application is licensed under the GPL3+ and depends on the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and the [LZMA](http://tukaani.org/xz/) libraries. The default program used to play streams is the [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) media player. The [Boost.Spirit](http://boost-spirit.com/home/) parser library is necessary to build the project.
